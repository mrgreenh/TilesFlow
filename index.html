            <h2>The Grid</h2>
            <p data-scrollToConf="points">
                First, you need a grid of points. But before than first you'll need to run <code>npm install tilesflow</code>. Then you are ready to go:
                <pre>
import TilesFlow from 'tilesflow';

var visualSettings = {
            //Colors are always expressed as four-dimensional vectors.
            // RGBA, you guessed it.
            pointsColor: [0,0,0,255]
        }
var tf = new TilesFlow("#containerId", [], visualSettings);
tf.render(0);
                </pre>
                The <code>#containerId</code> thinghy is the id of the element where you want this visualization to appear. A canvas element will be appended to it automatically. For example, you can use a <code>div</code> as a container.
            </p>

            <h2>Distances Between Points</h2>
            <p data-scrollToConf="step">
                What's the 0 in <code>tf.render(0)</code> you ask? That's the phase of the animation. It can be any number really, and TilesFlow will automatically coerce it into a number between 0 and <var>step</var>. <var>step</var> is 100 by default, but you can customize it by specifying a different value for it in visualSettings. It will change the resolution of the grid. What you see above is a <var>step</var> of 50.
            </p>

            <h2>Triangles</h2>
            <p data-ScrollToConf="triangles">
                These points are all connected by shapes. Right now only triangles are supported, because I'm lazy. Where are the triangles then? Add a stroke color to the visualSettings to see them!

                <pre>
var visualSettings = {
            stroke: [0,0,0,100],
            pointsColor: [0,255,0,255]
        }
                </pre>
            </p>

            <p>
                You might have some questions at this point. Why triangles? Or why is each odd column of points offsetted by half step? Well, the answer is: it's art. I liked it better that way. For example I wanted to use triangles, and having a grid like this allows me to have a more dense flow of triangles by using less points. Cuz points are expensive :/
            </p>

            <h2>Colors</h2>
            <p data-scrollToConf="colors">
                As you probably noticed by now, colors are expressed as four-dimensional vectors. And yeah, you guessed it, that's the RGBA space. All values go from 0 to 255. Now, I imagine you want to see some colors. You can set a color for the lines, a color for the points, and a color for the connecting triangles in the <var>visualSettings</var>:
                <pre>
var visualSettings = {
            stroke: [100,0,100,255],
            pointsColor: [200,0,200,255],
            baseColor: [250,250,0,100]
}
                </pre>
            </p>

            <h2>Forces</h2>
            <p>
                Now this is where it gets fun. You were probably wondering what is that <code>[]</code> that was left empty in <code>new TilesFlow("#containerId", [], visualSettings)</code>.
                That is the <var>forceField</var>.
            </p>
            <p data-scrollToConf="forces">
                Let's go ahead and give our visualization a forcefield to see what happens:

                <pre>
var forceField = [
    {
         x: 50,
         y: 40,
         decay: "linear",
         intensity: 100,
         influencePosition: true
   }
]

var visualConfig = {
    stroke: [100,0,100,255],
    pointsColor: [0,0,0,255],
    baseColor: [250,250,0,100],
    showForces: true,
    padding: [0,0,1,0]
}

var tf = new TilesFlow("#containerId", forceField, visualSettings);
tf.render(0);
                </pre>

            </p>
            <p>
                Cool uh? That red point in the middle of the canvas is the force. We see it thanks to the <var>showForces</var> option. It is pushing apart the points that get in its proximity with an <var>intensity</var> of 100. As a result also the triangles get distorted. It's x and y position are expressed in percentage, this means <code>x: 50, y: 50</code> would position the force in the middle of the canvas. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The <var>decay</var> is <var>linear</var>, which is the default option, but you can also use <var>cosine</var>, <var>sine</var> <var>clipping_power</var> at the time of writing.
            </p>

            <p data-scrollToConf="padding">
                The <var>padding</var> option in the visual settings is just causing the lowest row of the dots to not be connected by any triangle. I added it because I didn't want the force to push any triangles outside of the viewport, to avoid that horrible-looking clipping.
            </p>
